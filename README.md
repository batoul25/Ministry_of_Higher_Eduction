# Ministry of Higher Education

The Ministry of Higher Education project is a web application developed by me under the Focal X company, with the valuable assistance of other trainees in the company. 




## Features

Admin Dashboard: The website includes an intuitive admin dashboard that allows the administrator to easily manage the data in each section of the website. The admin has the ability to create, delete, and update data as needed, providing full control over the website's content.




## Technologies Used

- Laravel: A powerful PHP framework for building robust web applications.
- MySQL: A reliable and scalable database management system.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Front-end technologies for creating an intuitive user interface.

- Clone the project repository from GitHub.

-  Configure the database connection in the .env file.
- Run database migrations to set up the database schema.
